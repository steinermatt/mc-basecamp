If you're new to Minecraft, switching from Bedrock Edition, or simply looking for a good starting set of mods to play the game - **Basecamp** is for you.Â 

**Basecamp** is a selection of hand-picked mods with the intention to make the in-game world more beautiful and immersive, yet preserving the iconic block design of Minecraft. 


**What's included?**

This modpack features many mods to make biomes more beautiful and immersive (via sound and more variations), it adds more animals (especially sealife) and allows you to have visible labels for your pets. 


It features plenty of new furniture (including modern devices such as kitchen sinks, toilets, microwaves etc.), new doors, trapdoors, roofs (!) and many new blocks and variations of existing blocks. All you need to build beautiful modern homes or cities.

*"Lighting is the new chrome!"* they say, well - that's why we added plenty of new light options.

And whether you go exploring or choose to build (or both), in **Basecamp** you'll find the *must-have* tools such as  tooltips to see what you're looking at and a powerful copy & paste tool that allows to import/export entire structures into your world. Waystones are included, as well as an automatic map. And if you should happen to die, well a corpse will hold all your possessions for you to retrieve. 

Also included is support for gaming controllers, a beautiful shader (supporting modern Mac silicon chips such as M1 or M2) and resourcepacks to make textures blend/connect to attached blocks ... oh, and of course a dark mode (inventory and splash screen).
